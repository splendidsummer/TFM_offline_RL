## About this chanllenge
The goal of [challenge in 2022](https://real-robot-challenge.com/) is to solve dexterous manipulation tasks with offline reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning. The participants are provided with datasets containing dozens of hours of robotic data and can evaluate their policies remotely on a cluster of real TriFinger robots.

Participants can tackle two tasks during the real-robot stage:
Pushing a cube to a target location on the ground and
lifting the cube to match a target position and orientation in the air.
Like last year’s challenge, the Real Robot Challenge III is featured in the NeurIPS 2022 Competition Track.
